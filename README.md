anRpackage
================

# Introduction

This package provides two primary functions:

1.  `euclidean()`: A function that implements the Euclidean algorithm to
    find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.
2.  `dijkstra()`: A function that uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to compute
    the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a given
    graph.

This document provides instructions on how to install and use these
functions.

The goal of anRpackage is to find the greatest common divisor of two
numbers and the shortest path in the graph by using euclidean and
dijkstra algorithms.

## Installation

You can install the development version of anRpackage from
[GitHub](https://github.com/lyuuuuY/R-package.git/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("anRpackage")
devtools::install_github("lyuuuuY/R-package")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(anRpackage)
euclidean(123612,13892347912)
wiki_graph <- data.frame(
v1 = c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,6,6),
v2 = c(2,3,6,1,3,4,1,2,4,6,2,3,5,4,6,1,3,5),
w = c(7,9,14,7,10,15,9,10,11,2,15,11,6,6,9,14,2,9)
   )
dijkstra(wiki_graph, 3)
```
